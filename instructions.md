# Before the presentation

The presentation will have the option of being interactive, meaning you can follow along with the examples. This isn't required, and you still will be able to take away a lot without doing so. However, if you are interested in diving even further into the use of Docker, please make sure you have completed these steps beforehand to make following along easier.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with a terminal.

## Required Software

A text editor such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime, Notepad, etc.

Please make sure you have Docker installed. You can check out the (main Docker webpage)[https://docs.docker.com/install/] to find specific installation instructions for your machine.

If you are using a linux machine, you will also need to separately (install Docker Compose)[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/].

And that's it! While we will be using other software during the presentation, you won't need to install it. It will all be handled by Docker!

## Required Files

Please clone (this repository)[https://github.com/cailyncodes/interactive-docker-tutorial.git].

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cailyncodes/interactive-docker-tutorial.git
```

In order to speed up the presentation, please pre-download some of the images that will be used. You can do so by running `./pre-presentation.sh` on Linux/Mac and `pre-presentation.bat` on Windows.
